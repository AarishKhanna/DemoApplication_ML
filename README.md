# DemoApplication_ML
Demo application using CoreML, Vision framework, ChatGPT to identify objects in image and tell about it to you in detail, recognize text in image and explain it you, detect your mood

This is a basic demo project that uses CoreML models, Vision framework and OpenAI APIs to identify objects in an image and tell you about it in detail, recognize text in image and explain it to you, and detect your mood

This project demonstrates the use case of Machine learning in iOS domain.
Machine learning has diverse applications and frameworks like CoreML and MLKit can help us achieve the same. This basic project was my starter towards machine learning implementations in iOS domain, which later on helped me to deliver more complex projects for my team in same domain.

Tech Stack Used:
-> SwiftUI (for iOS Code)
-> CoreML and Vision Framework
